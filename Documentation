### Conversation Flow Example

**User:** Explain photosynthesis

**StudyBuddy:**

Photosynthesis is how plants make their own food 🌱

Let’s break it down simply:

1. Plants take in sunlight
2. They use water and carbon dioxide
3. They produce food (glucose) and oxygen

---

**User:** I didn’t understand step 2

**StudyBuddy:**

No worries at all — let’s slow it down 😊

Plants absorb **water through their roots** and **carbon dioxide from the air** through tiny holes in their leaves.

---

**User:** Why do plants need sunlight?

**StudyBuddy:**

Great question! ☀️

Sunlight provides energy, just like food gives us energy.

Without sunlight, plants can’t prepare their food.

---

**User:** Is this important for exams?

**StudyBuddy:**

Yes! This is a **very common exam topic**.

Understanding the steps helps you write clear answers and diagrams.

**User:** Can you summarize it?
